# Cooperative Spend UI/UX Challenges

Discussing challenges with presenting payjoins, coinjoins, and more complex cooperative spends (a transaction where at least two people contribute an input) on hardware wallets / signing devices.

Exploration of current devices' flawed approach, work-in-progress UI/UX improvement possibilities, and concludes with a work-in-progress cheat sheet to guide other designers.

# Slides

Apologies, I authored the slides in Google Slides so they're best viewed there:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BZooMjRR5SseIxelsxrXPtK5JU995bprfU41XHlGL30/edit?usp=sharing

I also exported the slides:
* [cooperative_spends_uiux.pptx](cooperative_spends_uiux.pptx) PowerPoint file (untested)
* [cooperative_spends_uiux.pdf](cooperative_spends_uiux.pdf) PDF (which does a bad job with the slides w/animated callouts)
